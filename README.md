# Multi-Head MobileNet V3 Quantization Tool

Create quantized MobileNet V3 models with custom multi-head classification outputs. This tool generates fully quantized TensorFlow Lite models (uint8 input/output) from MobileNet V3 architectures with your choice of classification heads. Models are Vela-compatible by default for Arm Ethos-U NPU deployment.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

Create a model with multiple heads:
```bash
python src/create_quantized_mobilenet_v3.py \
    --heads "5,2,3" \
    --output-dir ./models
```

This creates a model with three heads: 5 classes, 2 classes, and 3 classes, saved as a quantized TFLite file.

For NPUs that require a single output tensor, use the `--unified-output` flag to create a concatenated output while keeping individual heads accessible for training.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy

The script uses the existing models package from this repository.

See [ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md](ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed setup instructions.
